# üå∏ Nishimiya's Dotfiles Bootstrap Script üå∏

This repository contains a bootstrap script to set up a new Arch Linux machine with my preferred packages and configurations. The script installs `yay` (AUR helper), clones my dotfiles repository, installs packages, copies configurations, and configures the Arch Linux mirror list.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A fresh installation of Arch Linux. (Recommended)
- Internet connection.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download the Bootstrap Script**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xangelkawaiix/hyprland-bootstrap.git
   cd hyprland-bootstrap
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**

   Before running the script, make sure it is executable:

   `chmod +x bootstrap.sh`

4. **Run the Bootstrap Script**

   Execute the bootstrap script:

   `./bootstrap.sh`

### What the Script Does

- **Install yay AUR Helper**

   The script installs `yay`, an AUR helper that allows you to install packages from the Arch User Repository.

- **Clone Dotfiles Repository**

   The script clones my dotfiles repository and changes into the repository directory.

- **Install Packages**

   The script installs the packages listed in `packages`. The packages are organized into categories for easier management.

- **Copy Configuration Files**

   The script copies the configuration files and folders from the repository to the appropriate locations in your home directory. It also creates symbolic links for `.profile`, `.zshenv`, `.zshrc`, and `.zprofile`.

- **Configure Arch Linux Mirror List**

   The script uses `reflector` to update the Arch Linux mirror list with the fastest mirrors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Package List

The `packages` file contains a list of packages organized into categories. Each category is commented for easier navigation. The script reads this file and installs the packages using `yay`.

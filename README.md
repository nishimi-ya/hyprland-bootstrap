# üå∏ Nishimiya's Dotfiles Bootstrap Script üå∏

This repository contains a bootstrap script to set up a new Arch Linux machine with my preferred packages and configurations. The script installs `yay` (AUR helper), clones my dotfiles repository, installs packages, copies configurations, and configures the Arch Linux mirror list.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A fresh installation of Arch Linux. (Recommended)
- Internet connection.

> [!CAUTION]
>  **Best Run on Minimal Arch Linux-based Distributions**  
>   This script is designed to be run on minimal Arch Linux-based systems. Running it on a more customized setup may lead to **conflicts** or **issues** with existing configurations.
> 
>  **Configuration Overwrite Warning**  
>   This script **does not** backup your existing user configurations. It will most likely **overwrite** or cause conflicts with any existing configurations in your home directory. Be cautious if you have custom settings already in place.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Automatic Uninstall for Dotfiles**  
>   The script does not include a mechanism for uninstalling or removing dotfiles. You will need to manually remove any dotfiles or configuration files added by the script from your system.

> [!TIP]
>  **Manual Package Removal**  
>   If you'd like to remove the packages installed by this script, you can manually inspect the `packages` file for a list of installed packages and remove them accordingly.

### What the Script Does

- **Install yay AUR Helper**

   The script installs `yay`, an AUR helper that allows you to install packages from the Arch User Repository.

- **Clone Dotfiles Repository**

   The script clones my dotfiles repository and changes into the repository directory.

- **Install Packages**

   The script installs the packages listed in `packages`. The packages are organized into categories for easier management.

- **Copy Configuration Files**

   The script copies the configuration files and folders from the repository to the appropriate locations in your home directory. It also creates symbolic links for `.profile`, `.zshenv`, `.zshrc`, and `.zprofile`.

- **Configure Arch Linux Mirror List**

   The script uses `reflector` to update the Arch Linux mirror list with the fastest mirrors.
Set Timedatectl for Dual Boot
The script configures timedatectl to ensure proper time handling in a dual-boot setup with Windows.

- **Configure GPG Agent**
  
   The script configures the gpg agent to use pinentry-qt for handling passphrase prompts.

- **Install Starship Prompt**
  
   The script installs and configures the starship prompt for a modern, minimal command-line interface.

- **Detect Windows for Dual Boot**
  
   The script runs os-prober to detect any Windows installations for dual boot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Package List

The `packages` file contains a list of packages organized into categories. Each category is commented for easier navigation. The script reads this file and installs the packages using `yay`.
